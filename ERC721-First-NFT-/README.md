I created an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) according to the ERC-721 standard on the Ethereum blockchain network. I designed this NFT's name as "CATHAMBURGER". ERC-721 is a standard for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain network and it differentiates from other NFT standards by stating that each token is unique. This can be used for a unique artwork, game item, or other similar things for CATHAMBURGER NFT.
